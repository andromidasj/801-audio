I worked with Westlake High Schoolâ€™s Marching Band during the fall of 2022 and learned how to operate all of their live sound equipment. They used a Presonus studio live series 3 32 channel board, and I learned how to set automated scenes, integrating patches from external software, and how to mic a marching band to sound the best they can in many different environments.
