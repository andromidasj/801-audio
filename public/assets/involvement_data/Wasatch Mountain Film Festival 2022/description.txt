In April of 2022 I went to the Wasatch Mountain Film Festival and it was a great experience. I watched 7 films, and they all had focus on the mountains in Utah and the greater west coast. Some were about locals in the Wasatch Mountains, while others focused on mountains in Alaska and Washington. I also attended a meet an greet with the producers behind one of the longer films, and it was great to hear what advice they had for aspiring film makers and what they felt would help the most for finding success early in your career.
