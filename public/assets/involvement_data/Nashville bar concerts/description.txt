On March 7th, 2023 I visited Nashville and had the opportunity to see two bands perform in two bars in Downtown Nashville. When listening to the first artist, one thing I noticed right away was how incredible the mix sounded even though it was a small space. The vocals were clear and crisp and you heard exactly what you needed to. This artist did a lot of country covers and it sounded great. The second group I listened to had the vocals buried in the mix a a bit, but everything still sounded great. They played lots of Eric Church and did a fantastic job.
