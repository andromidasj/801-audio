On January 26th, 2023 I watched a screening of The Tuba Thieves which was part of The Sundance Film Festival. This film was extremely abstract and experimental with no real premise or story being told. It had a strong emphasis on the sounds all around you in all environments, which was very cool for about the first ten minutes, but it had nothing else interesting about it. The lack of a story or anything to move it forward made it extremely hard to watch.
