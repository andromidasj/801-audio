On February 10th, 2023 I saw Robbie Law and The Bandits at The Boardwalk. This was a great sounding group that played a lot of classic rock and country. The mix of the band wasnâ€™t great early on, but after about three songs it was much better for the rest of the night. They had a fantastic guitar player and a keytar player which was really fun.
