I went to the Velour on August 27, 2022 and listened to two bands. The first group, Botanical Animal, sounded great! I loved the reverb on the lead vocals and they had a really full sound. The second group, Basement Waves, had great energy but the mix wasn’t nearly as good as the first group. I couldn’t hear the vocals nearly as well and there wasn’t much low end to support the mix.
