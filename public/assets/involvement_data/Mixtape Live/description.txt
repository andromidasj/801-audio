On October 28, 2022 I went to UVUâ€™s Mixtape Live which was a showcase of the commercial music groups. It was a fun night and the performances from the groups were great! The mix in the last group I listened to was very vocal heavy, and it was distracting throughout each of their songs. Other than that, I really enjoyed all of the performances.
